1. Overview:
     The provided source code defines two interfaces in the 'bank' package. The 'BankTransfer' interface represents a transfer operation between two bank accounts, while the 'Account' interface provides methods for depositing and withdrawing money from an account.

  2. Package/module name:
     bank

  3. Class/file names:
     - BankTransfer (interface)
     - Account (interface)

  4. Detailed Documentation:

     - BankTransfer interface:
       Description: This interface represents a transfer operation between two bank accounts.
       Methods:
         - transfer(BankAccount from, BankAccount to, int amount): Transfers the specified amount of money from one account to another.
       Parameters:
         - from (BankAccount): The source account for the transfer.
         - to (BankAccount): The destination account for the transfer.
         - amount (int): The amount of money to be transferred.
       Return Values:
         - None (void).
       Important Logic:
         - This interface does not contain any logic; it only defines a contract that must be implemented by classes that implement this interface.

     - Account interface:
       Description: This interface represents the basic operations of a bank account, such as depositing and withdrawing money.
       Methods:
         - deposit(int amount): Deposits the specified amount of money into the account.
         - withdraw(int amount): Withdraws the specified amount of money from the account.
       Parameters:
         - amount (int): The amount of money to be deposited or withdrawn.
       Return Values:
         - None (void).
       Important Logic:
         - This interface does not contain any logic; it only defines a contract that must be implemented by classes that implement this interface.

  5. Pseudo Code:
     The pseudocode for the provided interfaces is not applicable since they are abstract and do not contain any implementation details. However, here's an example of how these interfaces could be used in a class implementing them:

```
// Class: BankAccount

// Method: deposit(amount)
1. Check if amount is greater than zero.
   - If not, throw an exception (InvalidAmountException).
2. Add the specified amount to the account balance.
3. Return true to indicate successful deposit.
4. Handle exceptions:
   - If an error occurs during the deposit operation, log the error and rethrow the exception.

// Method: withdraw(amount)
1. Check if amount is greater than zero.
   - If not, throw an exception (InvalidAmountException).
2. Check if there are sufficient funds in the account balance.
   - If not, throw an exception (InsufficientFundsException).
3. Subtract the specified amount from the account balance.
4. Return true to indicate successful withdrawal.
5. Handle exceptions:
   - If an error occurs during the withdrawal operation, log the error and rethrow the exception.
