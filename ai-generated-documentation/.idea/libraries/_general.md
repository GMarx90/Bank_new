 for the withdrawal.
            - If not, throw an exception or return a failure status.
         2. Subtract the specified amount from the account balance.

The provided source code consists of two interfaces: BankTransfer and Account. The BankTransfer interface defines a method for transferring money between accounts, while the Account interface handles depositing and withdrawing money from an individual account.
Here's how these interfaces could be implemented in more detail:

- BankTransfer Interface:
  - Method: `transfer(from, to, amount)`
    - This method initiates a transfer of a specified amount between two accounts: 'from' and 'to'. It firstly checks if the 'from' account has sufficient balance for the transfer. If not, it throws an exception or returns a failure status. Subsequently, it withdraws the specified amount from the 'from' account and deposits the same amount into the 'to' account. This ensures that the total amount of money in both accounts remains constant during the transfer process.

- Account Interface:
  - Method: `deposit(amount)`
    - This method adds the specified amount to the account balance, increasing the total funds available in the account.
  - Method: `withdraw(amount)`
    - This method checks if the account has sufficient balance for the withdrawal. If not, it throws an exception or returns a failure status. Otherwise, it subtracts the specified amount from the account balance, decreasing the total funds available in the account.
