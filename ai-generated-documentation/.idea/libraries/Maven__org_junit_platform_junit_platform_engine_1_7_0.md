1. Overview:
     The provided source code defines two interfaces in the 'bank' package. The 'BankTransfer' interface represents a transfer operation between two bank accounts, while the 'Account' interface provides methods for depositing and withdrawing money from an account.

  2. Package/module name:
     bank

  3. Class/file names:
     - BankTransfer (interface)
     - Account (interface)

  4. Detailed Documentation:

     - BankTransfer interface:
       Description: This interface represents a transfer operation between two bank accounts.

       Return Values:
         - None (void).
       Important Logic:
         - This interface does not contain any logic; it only defines the method signature for transferring money between accounts.

  5. Pseudo Code:
     The provided source code is already in a form of pseudocode as it's written in Java interfaces, which are used to define abstract methods that must be implemented by classes that implement the interface. Therefore, there's no need for additional pseudocode.
