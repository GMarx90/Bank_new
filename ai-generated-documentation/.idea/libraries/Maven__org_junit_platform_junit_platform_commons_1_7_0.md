1. Overview:
     The provided source code defines two interfaces in the 'bank' package. The 'BankTransfer' interface represents a transfer operation between two bank accounts, while the 'Account' interface provides methods for depositing and withdrawing money from an account.

  2. Package/module name:
     bank

  3. Class/file names:
     - BankTransfer (interface)
     - Account (interface)

  4. Detailed Documentation:

     - BankTransfer interface:
       Description: This interface represents a transfer operation between two bank accounts.
       Methods:
         - transfer(BankAccount from, BankAccount to, int amount): Transfers the specified amount of money from one account to another.
       Parameters:

       Return Values:
         - None (void).
       Important Logic:
         - This interface does not contain any logic; it only defines the method signature for transferring money between accounts.

     - Account interface:
       Description: This interface represents a bank account that can be used to deposit and withdraw money.
       Methods:
         - deposit(int amount): Deposits the specified amount of money into the account.
         - withdraw(int amount): Withdraws the specified amount of money from the account.

       Important Logic:
         - This interface does not contain any logic; it only defines the method signatures for depositing and withdrawing money from an account.

  5. Pseudo Code:
     The pseudocode for this program is not applicable as the provided source code consists of interfaces with no implementation. Interfaces in Java are used to achieve abstraction and multiple inheritance by classes that implement them.
