1. Overview:
     The provided source code defines two interfaces in the 'bank' package. The 'BankTransfer' interface represents a transfer operation between two bank accounts, while the 'Account' interface provides methods for depositing and withdrawing money from an account.

  2. Package/module name:
     bank

  3. Class/file names:
     - BankTransfer (interface)
     - Account (interface)

  4. Detailed Documentation:

     - BankTransfer interface:
       Description: This interface represents a transfer operation between two bank accounts.
       Methods:
         - transfer(BankAccount from, BankAccount to, int amount): Transfers the specified amount of money from one account to another.
       Parameters:
         - from (BankAccount): The source account for the transfer.
         - to (BankAccount): The destination account for the transfer.
         - amount (int): The amount of money to be transferred.
       Return Values:
         - None (void).
       Important Logic:
         - This interface does not contain any logic; it only defines a contract that must be implemented by classes that implement this interface.

     - Account interface:
       Description: This interface represents the basic operations of a bank account, such as depositing and withdrawing money.
       Methods:
         - deposit(int amount): Deposits the specified amount of money into the account.
         - withdraw(int amount): Withdraws the specified amount of money from the account.
       Parameters:
         - amount (int): The amount of money to be deposited or withdrawn.
       Return Values:
         - None (void).
       Important Logic:
         - This interface does not contain any logic; it only defines a contract that must be implemented by classes that implement this interface.

  5. Pseudo Code:
     The pseudocode for the interfaces is not provided as they are abstract and do not contain implementation details. However, here's an example of how these interfaces could be used in a class implementing them:

```
// Class: BankAccount

// Method: deposit(int amount)
  1. Check if the amount is positive.
    - If not, throw an exception.
  2. Add the amount to the account balance.

// Method: withdraw(int amount)
  1. Check if the amount is positive and less than or equal to the account balance.
    - If not, throw an exception.
  2. Subtract the amount from the account balance.

// Class: BankTransferImpl (implements BankTransfer)

// Method: transfer(BankAccount from, BankAccount to, int amount)
  1. Check if the amount is positive and less than or equal to the balance of 'from' account.
    - If not, throw an exception.
  2. Withdraw the amount from 'from' account.
  3. Deposit the amount into 'to' account.
