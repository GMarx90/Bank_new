1. Overview:
     The provided source code defines two interfaces in the 'bank' package. The 'BankTransfer' interface represents a transfer operation between two bank accounts, while the 'Account' interface provides methods for depositing and withdrawing money from an account.

  2. Package/module name:
     bank

  3. Class/file names:
     - BankTransfer (interface)
     - Account (interface)

  4. Detailed Documentation:

     - BankTransfer interface:
       Description: This interface represents a transfer operation between two bank accounts.
       Methods:
         - transfer(BankAccount from, BankAccount to, int amount): Transfers the specified amount of money from one account to another.
       Parameters:
         - from (BankAccount): The source account from which the money is transferred.
         - to (BankAccount): The destination account to which the money is transferred.
         - amount (int): The amount of money to be transferred.
       Return Values:
         - None (void).
       Important Logic:
         - This interface does not contain any logic; it only defines the method signature for transferring money between accounts.

     - Account interface:
       Description: This interface represents a bank account that can be used to deposit and withdraw money.
       Methods:
         - deposit(int amount): Deposits the specified amount of money into the account.
         - withdraw(int amount): Withdraws the specified amount of money from the account.
       Parameters:
         - amount (int): The amount of money to be deposited or withdrawn.
       Return Values:
         - None (void).
       Important Logic:
         - This interface does not contain any logic; it only defines the method signatures for depositing and withdrawing money from an account.

  5. Pseudo Code:
     The pseudocode for this program is not provided as the source code only contains interfaces with no implementation. However, here's a general outline of how the pseudocode might look for a class that implements these interfaces:

     // Class: BankAccount

     // Method: deposit(int amount)
       1. Check if the amount is greater than zero.
         - If not, throw an exception.
       2. Add the amount to the account balance.

     // Method: withdraw(int amount)
       1. Check if the amount is greater than zero.
         - If not, throw an exception.
       2. Check if there are sufficient funds in the account.
         - If not, throw an exception.
       3. Subtract the amount from the account balance.

     // Class: BankTransferImpl (implements BankTransfer)

     // Method: transfer(BankAccount from, BankAccount to, int amount)
       1. Check if the amount is greater than zero.
         - If not, throw an exception.
       2. Withdraw the amount from the source account.
       3. Deposit the amount into the destination account.
       4. Handle exceptions:
         - If an error occurs during withdrawal or deposit, log the error and rethrow the exception.
