1. Overview:
     The provided source code defines two interfaces in the 'bank' package. The 'BankTransfer' interface represents a transfer operation between two bank accounts, while the 'Account' interface provides methods for depositing and withdrawing money from an account.

  2. Package/module name:
     bank

  3. Class/file names:
     - BankTransfer (interface)
     - Account (interface)

  4. Detailed Documentation:

     - BankTransfer interface:
       Description: This interface represents a transfer operation between two bank accounts.
       Methods:
         - transfer(BankAccount from, BankAccount to, int amount): Transfers the specified amount of money from one account to another.
       Parameters:
         - from (BankAccount): The source account for the transfer.
         - to (BankAccount): The destination account for the transfer.
         - amount (int): The amount of money to be transferred.
       Return Values:
         - None (void)
       Important Logic:
         - This interface does not contain any logic; it only defines the method signature that any class implementing this interface must provide.

     - Account interface:
       Description: This interface provides methods for depositing and withdrawing money from an account.
       Methods:
         - deposit(int amount): Deposits the specified amount of money into the account.
         - withdraw(int amount): Withdraws the specified amount of money from the account.
       Parameters:
         - amount (int): The amount of money to be deposited or withdrawn.
       Return Values:
         - None (void)
       Important Logic:
         - This interface does not contain any logic; it only defines the method signatures that any class implementing this interface must provide.

  5. Pseudo Code:
     The pseudocode for the provided interfaces is not applicable since they are just declarations of methods without any implementation. However, here's a general pseudocode for a possible implementation of these interfaces:

```
// Class: BankTransferImpl (implements BankTransfer)

// Method: transfer(from, to, amount)
  1. Validate the input parameters:
    - Check if 'from', 'to' are not null and refer to different accounts.
    - Check if 'amount' is greater than zero.
  2. Withdraw the specified amount from the source account (from).
  3. Deposit the same amount into the destination account (to).
  4. Handle exceptions:
    - If any validation fails or an error occurs during withdrawal/deposit, log the error and rethrow the exception.
